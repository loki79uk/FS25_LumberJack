https://github.com/loki79uk/FS25_LumberJack/releases/tag/v1.0.0.3
- Menus are back on the menu
- Super strength is now WORKING in MULTIPLAYER

*** Huge thanks to shad0wlife ***

NOTES:
- Individual player pick-up distances not yet working for multiplayer
- In MP the game settings menu goes all white and looks broken after logging in as admin.  Reset after open/close menu.
- I did have the server event handle numbers and strings too, but neither maxWoodchips or destroyFoliageSize menu updated properly, needs more work..
